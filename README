Changes Treasure Maps to follow the same format as other maps, "Treasure Map: Location", corrects "Orsinium" to Wrothgar and expands out "Alik'r" and "Bleakrock".

Note: Inventory caching means that changes may not take effect immediately. Also some places whee item names are displayed are unaffected by this addon.
